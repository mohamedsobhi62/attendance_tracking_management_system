## Overview:
- Attendance Tracking Management System (ATMS) is a part of an HR 
System, that allows the Admin to track the attendance and leaving of the 
employees, tracks their availability during the day, and manages their 
profiles.
- The leaving process is divided into two types of leaving:
* One that needs approval from the admin.
* One that is the ordinary leaving which does not need any 
approvals.
- The Admin has all privileges to edit the employees’ data and accept or 
reject their leaving requests.
- The Employee checks in and out on the system and applies for leave 
requests.
